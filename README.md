# About code-quiz

This code quiz is an assignment that tests concepts I've learned thus far: DOM manipulation, event listeners, arrays, local storage, and effective naming conventions. I've focused mostly on the functionality of this project and less on the styling.

I have created a timed, one minute, five question quiz based off the sample animated GIF. Each time the user answers the question correctly, they proceed to the next question. If answered incorrectly, it will console log "Incorrect!" and they lose 10 seconds of the remaining time.

The score the user receives is based on the time remaining, if they successfully complete the quiz. They can then type their name in the end and have their score recorded on the last screen.

This is the longest code I've written so far! Over 200 lines but with comments and some white space included.
